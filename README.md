# zsh-ghcup

## Overview

This zsh plugin installs GHCup if not already installed,
defaulting to `$HOME/.ghcup` or `$GHCUP_ROOT` if
specified.

After ensuring that ghcup is installed, it then initializes
ghcup for use in the current shell.

I created this because I couldn't find another existing plugin
for this, and I want to reduce the amount of work to install
a zsh environment on a new system.

## Installation
Use your favorite zsh plugin manager to install this plugin (e.g. [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)).
